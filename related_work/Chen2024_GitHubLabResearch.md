## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
Laboratory research involves complex, collaborative processes across hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data generation/analysis, and manuscript writing. While reproducibility and data sharing are prioritized at publication stage, integrating these principles at earlier research stages lacks broadly applicable solutions.

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- Version control systems are primarily for software development, not laboratory research
- Research documentation and collaboration tools should be purpose-built for scientific workflows
- Git-based workflows are too technical for most researchers
- Laboratory research requires specialized platforms different from software development tools

### Key Insight
The workflow used in modern software development offers a robust framework for enhancing reproducibility and collaboration in laboratory research. GitHub can be effectively adapted to organize and document all aspects of a research project's lifecycle in molecular biology laboratories.

### Technical Approach
Three-step approach for incorporating GitHub ecosystem into laboratory research:

1. **Design and organize experiments** using GitHub issues and project boards
   - Issues track individual experiments, hypotheses, and tasks
   - Project boards provide visual workflow management
   - Milestones organize larger research goals

2. **Document experiments and data analyses** with version control
   - Track all code, protocols, and analysis scripts
   - Maintain detailed commit messages documenting experimental decisions
   - Use branches for different experimental approaches
   - Archive raw data with appropriate metadata

3. **Ensure reproducible software environments** with containerized packages
   - Docker containers for computational environments
   - Environment specification files (requirements.txt, environment.yml)
   - Integration with cloud computing platforms

### Evaluation
- Case study implementation in molecular biology laboratory
- Template repository provided for adoption: https://github.com/rasilab/github_template
- Demo repository showing practical implementation: https://github.com/rasilab/github_demo
- Qualitative assessment of workflow effectiveness

### Impact
- **Immediate**: Provides practical framework for laboratory adoption of version control
- **Field-level**: Challenges assumption that scientific research requires specialized tools
- **Broader**: Demonstrates feasibility of adapting software development practices to experimental sciences
- **Future work**: Sets foundation for automated research documentation and AI-assisted laboratory workflows

## Key Assumptions Identified
1. **Traditional**: Laboratory research documentation should be separate from code development
2. **Challenged**: Software development workflows can effectively manage experimental research
3. **New assumption**: Version control can serve as unified platform for research lifecycle management

## Relevance to Version Control for Science
This paper directly addresses version control application in scientific research, providing concrete implementation framework. Particularly relevant for understanding how git-based systems can track experimental workflows beyond just computational work.
