# Literature Review

## Overview

Version control for science represents an emerging paradigm that extends traditional software development practices to support the full spectrum of scientific research activities. This literature review examines the current state of research on version control applications in scientific computing, reproducible research workflows, and human-AI collaboration in research contexts.

## Research Landscape Analysis

### Current State of Version Control in Science

The application of version control systems to scientific research has evolved from simple code tracking to comprehensive research lifecycle management. Three primary research directions have emerged:

1. **Infrastructure and Technical Frameworks** - Systems for managing computational environments, data, and workflows
2. **Human-Computer Interaction** - How scientists actually use computational tools and what they need
3. **Collaborative Research Systems** - Platforms enabling human-human and human-AI collaboration

### Key Literature Themes

#### Theme 1: Git-Based Laboratory Research Management

**Representative Work:** Chen et al. (2024) - "GitHub is an effective platform for collaborative and reproducible laboratory research"

**Problem Addressed:** Laboratory research lacks broadly applicable solutions for integrating reproducibility and collaboration principles at early research stages.

**Key Insight:** Software development workflows can be effectively adapted to organize all aspects of research project lifecycles, not just computational components.

**Literature Assumptions Challenged:**
- Version control systems are primarily for software development
- Scientific research requires specialized, purpose-built collaboration tools
- Git-based workflows are too technical for most researchers

**Impact:** Provides concrete framework for laboratory adoption of version control, with template repositories and practical implementation guidance.

#### Theme 2: Comprehensive Reproducibility Infrastructure

**Representative Work:** Dasgupta & Nuyujukian (2024) - "ARTS: An open framework for archival, reproducible, and transparent science"

**Problem Addressed:** Despite accessible data and code, barriers to recreating scientific findings remain high due to missing computational environments and execution pipelines.

**Key Insight:** True reproducibility requires preserving not just data and code, but complete computational contexts including environments, dependencies, and execution workflows.

**Literature Assumptions Challenged:**
- Sharing code and data files is sufficient for reproducibility
- Computational environments can be adequately described in text
- Static archives are adequate for long-term preservation

**Impact:** Establishes technical framework addressing federal mandates for research data management while promoting cultural shift toward proactive reproducibility.

#### Theme 3: Process-Centric Research Documentation

**Representative Work:** Oderinwale et al. (2025) - "Procedural Knowledge Libraries: Towards Executable (Research) Memory"

**Problem Addressed:** Traditional research documentation captures outcomes but loses tacit knowledge embedded in research processes - hypotheses, failures, decisions, and iterations.

**Key Insight:** Research processes are as valuable as research products. Systematic capture of complete research reasoning chains creates "executable memory" for dramatically improved reproducibility.

**Literature Assumptions Challenged:**
- Research outputs (papers, datasets) are the primary valuable artifacts
- Research processes are too complex to systematically capture
- Static documentation of methods is sufficient

**Impact:** Extends version control concepts to capture complete research reasoning, informing how systems could track decision-making evolution.

#### Theme 4: AI-Enabled Collaborative Research

**Representative Work:** Schmidgall et al. (2025) - "AgentRxiv: Towards Collaborative Autonomous Research"

**Problem Addressed:** Existing AI research agents work in isolation without ability to continuously improve upon prior research results or collaborate with other agents.

**Key Insight:** AI agents can collaborate and build incrementally on each other's research through shared knowledge repositories, mimicking human scientific collaboration patterns.

**Literature Assumptions Challenged:**
- AI research agents should work independently on isolated problems
- Scientific collaboration requires human mediation
- AI agents cannot meaningfully build upon each other's work

**Impact:** Demonstrates 11.4% performance improvement when agents access prior research, establishing paradigm for AI agent scientific collaboration.

### Empirical Understanding of Scientific Computing Practices

**Representative Work:** Huang et al. (2025) - "How Scientists Use Jupyter Notebooks: Goals, Quality Attributes, and Opportunities"

**Observational Study Findings:**
- Scientists prioritize different quality attributes depending on specific goals
- State management across sessions is a critical unmet need
- Dependency tracking is essential but poorly supported in current tools
- Scientists need sophisticated abstraction and reuse capabilities

**Implications for Version Control:**
- Evidence for goal-dependent version control requirements
- State management challenges highlight specific technical needs
- Dependency tracking requirements inform version control system design
- AI tool integration creates new collaboration patterns requiring systematic tracking

## Cross-Cutting Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Human-AI Collaboration Interfaces
While AgentRxiv demonstrates AI-AI collaboration and traditional tools support human-human collaboration, systematic approaches for human-AI collaborative research workflows remain underexplored.

### Gap 2: Fine-Grained Research Process Tracking
Current systems track file-level changes but not decision-level rationales. PKL framework proposes solutions, but implementation and evaluation remain limited.

### Gap 3: Domain-Specific Version Control Requirements
Most research assumes generic version control needs across scientific domains. Evidence suggests different fields may require specialized approaches.

### Gap 4: Scalability of Comprehensive Reproducibility
ARTS and similar frameworks provide technical solutions but questions remain about adoption barriers, storage costs, and long-term sustainability at scale.

## Synthesis: Emerging Bit Flips in the Literature

### Identified Bit Flip 1
**Bit:** Version control is primarily a software development tool  
**Flip:** Version control serves as foundation for comprehensive research lifecycle management

**Evidence:** Chen et al.'s GitHub laboratory framework, ARTS integration of containers with Git, PKL extension to decision tracking

### Identified Bit Flip 2  
**Bit:** Research documentation should focus on final outcomes and methods  
**Flip:** Research processes and decision-making contexts are primary knowledge artifacts

**Evidence:** PKL executable memory concept, software provenance tracking requirements, scientist workflow studies revealing process management needs

### Identified Bit Flip 3
**Bit:** Scientific collaboration requires human expertise and judgment  
**Flip:** AI agents can participate as collaborative research partners with systematic knowledge sharing

**Evidence:** AgentRxiv collaborative improvements, SciSciGPT human-AI collaboration frameworks, emerging AI copilot research tools

## Research Opportunities

### High-Impact Research Directions

1. **Human-AI Collaboration Version Control**
   - Design systems supporting joint human-AI research workflows
   - Track attribution and decision-making across hybrid teams
   - Enable seamless handoffs between human and AI contributors

2. **Context-Aware Research Process Tracking**
   - Capture not just what changed but why decisions were made
   - Integrate with computational environments for complete provenance
   - Support different levels of granularity for different research phases

3. **Domain-Adaptive Version Control Systems**
   - Identify domain-specific requirements across scientific fields
   - Develop adaptive interfaces supporting different research methodologies
   - Create domain-specific metadata and tracking schemas

### Methodological Contributions

The literature demonstrates growing sophistication in empirical research on scientific computing practices. Future work should build on observational studies like Huang et al.'s to understand:
- How version control systems can support discovered workflow patterns
- What abstraction levels best serve different research goals
- How AI integration changes collaboration and documentation needs
